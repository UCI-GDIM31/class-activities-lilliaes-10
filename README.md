### W2 1. The r, g, and b variables are floats instead of ints, bools, or strings because they are not whole number values and can be decimals.2. The _bounce variable is an int instead of float, bool, or string because the ball bounces only in whole numbers which is represented by integers. 3. The error shows me the exact row and column that the error occurred and the issue that needs to be fixed.

### W3 The player sanity level is the input (parameters) and there is no output/return type since the method changes the light itself.
